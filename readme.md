# K-means Clustering for Food Groups/Ingredients

This project demonstrates the application of K-means clustering to group food ingredients. K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning technique used for partitioning data into distinct groups or clusters.

## Overview

The script provided utilizes the K-means clustering algorithm to cluster a list of food ingredients into distinct groups based on their similarity. The ingredients are first converted into a numerical feature matrix using the CountVectorizer from scikit-learn, and then K-means clustering is applied. Additionally, the TF-IDF vectorizer is used for comparison, showing an alternative approach.

## Additional Notes
- Feel free to fork the project and expand the list of ingredients by adding more items to the ingredients list in the script.
- Experiment with different clustering algorithms or similarity measures for alternative results.
